# Segment Anything

Segment Anything by Alexander Kirillov et al. (Meta AI Research, FAIR) proposes a new task, model and dataset for image segmentation.

The goal of the Segment Anything project is to build a foundational model for image segmentation that solves a range of downstream segmentation problems on new data distributions using prompt engineering.
