# Structured Query Language (SQL)
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to manage and retrieve data from relational databases. It allows you to interact with databases by writing commands called queries. With SQL, you can create, modify, and delete database tables, as well as insert, update, and retrieve data. It provides powerful tools to search, sort, and filter data based on specific criteria. SQL is widely used in businesses and organizations to handle vast amounts of information efficiently. It's essential for tasks like data analysis, reporting, and building applications that rely on storing and accessing structured data.
