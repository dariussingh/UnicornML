# Machine Learning (ML)
Machine learning is a field of study that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves using data to train these algorithms, allowing them to identify patterns, make predictions, and gain insights from the information provided. Machine learning algorithms can automatically improve their performance through experience, adjusting their parameters to optimize their outputs. It finds applications in various domains, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics. Machine learning plays a crucial role in advancing artificial intelligence and enabling computers to learn and adapt from data.
